This session will HEAVILY focus on the debugger. We'll also use the remaining time to work on the 
struct program we started last session

    - How to run the debugger

## SESSION ACTIVITIES   

### Study Guide Suggestions 

Spend the first few minutes of the session asking students about the study guide and if they have anything theyâ€™d like to add as a group.


### Going over GDB Commands + What they do

As the title suggests, have students list as many gdb commands they can remember on the board and individually explain what they do.

Once 5 minutes have gone up, spend an additional 5 minutes to have them look up the remaining commands.


### Debugging faulty.c

Using a buggy implementation of a program that is meant to compute the factorial of some number, go through the process of setting breakpoints and printing out values of variables with the help of the students in the section


### Messing with Structs Cont.

If we have additional time, have them resume on the students.c program we did last session. If they finish, project their solutions to the screen.


### Study Guide

Add onto the study guide and answer any questions students may have.
