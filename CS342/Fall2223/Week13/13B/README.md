# Counting to 20 using Threads
Using threading, I want to have a program that counts up to 20 using multiple
threads. The program uses a main c file (main.c) to create a number of "counter"
threads. counter.c counts up to 20 where it then stops and waits for the other
threads to finish.

This may be a bit of a challenging activity, so I'd advise to walk through it with 
students and maybe even have this activity span 2 sessions.
