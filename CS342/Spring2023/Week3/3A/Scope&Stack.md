# Scope and the Stack

This session will be pretty light in terms of new material, drawing mostly from the last session's programming
assignment as the bulk of the content.

## MAIN CONCEPTS

- Stack
    - Where local memory is stored in the OS
- Scope
    - Defines what and how our functions/variables are called
        - static
            - private
        - no keyword
            - public

## SESSION ACTIVITIES   

### Wordle

Spend the first 5-ish minutes playing wordle. If people have already played today’s wordle, just have that 
person write out the letters on the board (and possibly give hints)


### Braindump

Use the next five minutes to have students put what they are confident in and what they are unsure about 
in C on the whiteboard. Leave this on the board until we are near the end of the session.

At the end of the session, go over some of the concepts the students wrote down and have them explain 
to each other what they wrote down. 


### Replacer Program Cont.

We started on a program that read input from a file last session. Spend about 20 minutes or so working 
some more on this. If we don’t finish in time, I’ll show the solution next session. 


### Quick Review of Scope and Stacks

As the title suggests, we’re going to quickly go over the stack and scope in C. Should take approximately 
5 minutes.
